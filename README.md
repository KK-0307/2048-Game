# 2048-Game
This project is a Java implementation of the popular sliding puzzle game 2048, where the objective is to combine tiles of the same number to reach the 2048 tile. Players slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid using keyboard controls, and each move introduces a new tile until the grid is full or the player reaches the 2048 tile.
